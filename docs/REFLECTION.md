This website is a tribute to the club I have dedicated most of my college life to. I have poured my heart and sole into Pitt Dance Marathon. I have been on the board for 3 years now, and am absolutely devastated to see our hard work from this year be destroyed by this horrible worldwide situation. However, I can see that this is much bigger than any Dance Marathon to exist, because it is affecting so many more people, so I keep reminding myself that the present situation is much more important.

I created a webpage for PDM with multiple tab options in the navigation bar. It explains what PDM is all about, gives a little background, has all the members, and provides links directly to our cause and actual site to donate. 

For baseline criteria, I think I hit all of it. I used color and visual rhythm to go along with the club's and school's colors/scheme. I included at least three navigable html locations, all with a clear mode of navigation among the locations. There is one site-wide css stylesheet, making everything cohesive. The images are all from the club, for which I have explicit permissions since I am on the board. The site successfully displays in a local web browser as well. 

As for aspirational criteria, the site loads over the internet, I used Flexbox layout, and the site has responsive design to dynamically resize elements based on screen width!

This was a difficult project for sure. I tried to take my time and really work on the tutorials so that I could use that info on the real thing.

This was one of the first days I was working on it, and I was just excited to have figured out what I wanted the layout to look like. Upon further work, it came together quite nicely. Here is a screenshot from atom:

I pushed the full draft, and received this feedback from classmates:

I took all of this into consideration, so I needed to figure out how to center my navigation buttons and fix my "Meet the Members" page. At this point, this is what it looked like:

I immediately began adding captions to all the members' photos, but then it came out like this:

I had toggled with it a bit after receiving help with my homepage photos and centering them, but I wanted them side-by-side in groups based on panels, so I went ahead and emailed Ben about it (as well as inquiring about the nav bar). He replied with this email:

This helped greatly, and I was able to fix the code in atom:

I struggled a lot with fonts, so after trying over and over again to change it, I gave up and submitted it with just a serif and sans-serif font style on each page. Other than that, I think I did a pretty great job!
