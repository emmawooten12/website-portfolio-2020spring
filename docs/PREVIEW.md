The screenshot preview is showing the little progress I have made so far on this project. I am excited to learn more about 
coding and how to execute the development of a website properly. So far, I have only been messing a little bit with the CSS 
rules on the homepage of my wesbite. This site is going to be a revamp for the student organization I care so much about 
(and everyone is tired of hearing about), Pitt Dance Marathon. I am showing what the homepage will start with, which is an 
introduction to what this club is all about. It features a description of the yearlong fundraising effort that is PDM, and what
causes we benefit. 

Going forward, I want to add a navigation bar right underneath the title. Each will be a link to a different page. I need to 
figure out how to properly execute that. I also need a refresher on how to insert links and images, so I can add pictures from
last year's event, the total we raised last year, pictures of the kids, and pictures of the whole PDM board (including the
executive members and chair positions). 

As for CSS, I am going to stay consistent with the Pitt Retro colors theme, as it is the official colors of PDM 2020. I want to
incorporate fun shapes and designs to flow with the message and represent PDM in the best light possible. I want to get really
comfortable with CSS so I can use various pop-out boxes, hover features, and add dimension to the site. My goal is to work on
this over spring break little by little and use the tutorials to guide my wesbite portfolio development.
