<h2>What is PDM?</h2>

<p>Pitt Dance Marathon strives to better the lives of children and their
  families at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. We aim to give kids the
  chance to celebrate more birthdays through raising money for CHP with our
  12-hour Children's Miracle Network Dance Marathon. This is the largest student-
  run philanthropy on Pitt's campus, and it is a yearlong fundraising effort. Last
  year, we proudly raised over $338,000, which is a $107,000 increase from the
  year before, and are only climbing from here! To find out more information
  on members, the cause, and how to donate, click the tabs above.
  As always, Hail to Pitt and Hail to Kids!
