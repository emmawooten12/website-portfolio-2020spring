# Project 3: Website Portfolio 

This website is a tribute to the club I have dedicated most of my college life to. I have poured my heart and sole into Pitt Dance Marathon. I have been on the board for 3 years now, and am absolutely devastated to see our hard work from this year be destroyed by this horrible worldwide situation. However, I can see that this is much bigger than any Dance Marathon to exist, because it is affecting so many more people, so I keep reminding myself that the present situation is much more important.

I created a webpage for PDM with multiple tab options in the navigation bar. It explains what PDM is all about, gives a little background, has all the members, and provides links directly to our cause and actual site to donate. I am pretty excited with how the draft has turned out so far. 

I am impressed with what I have come up with considering the fact that coding is entirely new to me. I was able to center the navigation bar buttons like I had hoped to as well. I fixed the "Meet to Members" page's formatting as well as adding titles and names to everyone's pictures. 

Something I struggled with was changing the font, and never ended up figuring it out. I am excited to have figured out how to make pictures into clickable external links on my "Our Cause" page, and made one of my nav bar buttons navigate entirely to another website to donate to the cause. 

Reflection to come soon!
