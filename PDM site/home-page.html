<h2>What is PDM?</h2>

<p>Pitt Danace Marathon strives to better the lives of children and their
  families at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. We aim to give kids the
  chance to celebrate more birthdays through raising money for CHP with our
  12-hour Children's Miracle Network Dance Marathon. This is the largest student-
  run philanthropy on Pitt's campus, and it is a yearlong fundraising effort.
