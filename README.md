# Project 3: Website Portfolio Full Draft

This website is a tribute to the club I have dedicated most of my college life to. I have poured my heart and sole into Pitt Dance Marathon. I have been on the board for 3 years now, and am absolutely devastated to see our hard work from this year be destroyed by this horrible worldwide situation. However, I can see that this is much bigger than any Dance Marathon to exist, because it is affecting so many more people, so I keep reminding myself that the present sitaution is much more important.

I created a webpage for PDM with multiple tab options in the navigation bar. It explains what PDM is all about, gives a little background, has all the members, and provides links directly to our cause and actual site to donate. I am pretty excited with how the draft has turned out so far. 

I am looking to improve several aspects of the site, but I am impressed with what I have come up with to this point. First off, I want to center the navigation bar buttons. I have tried several times by using "flex" in the CSS file, but it only seems to be moving the text. Furthermore, on the "Meet the Members" page, I need to add titles and name under each picture, but I do not know how to put captions for each picture rather than just a < p > section in the .html code. I also just want to make the pages look nicer with more interesting fonts and backgrounds. I could add color borders to the pictures and more design features to each page.

I will transfer this text over to a file called "FULLDRAFT.md" once I push a final website with a reflection. The reflection will become the "README.md" file.

Most assets used for this site come from pdm.pitt.edu, which I have full admin access to as I am part of the club! I used this as inspiration, but definitely tried to put my own take on the club and what the site should be.

The font used comes from [this site] (https://atom.io/packages/fonts)
